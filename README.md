# hello-world
This Repository is a basic introduction and help guide into creating a repository on GitHub for projects
My goal with GitHub is to collaborate with others and gain a better understanding of how I can be a successful data scientist to help my company grow their client base
The way I am achieving this is through online courses on Coursera. To met my goals I need to break it down into manageable steps.
These steps are as follows:
- [x] Sign up for Data Scientist Toolbox Course
- [ ] Complete lessons in a timely fashion by committing 1 hour a day to them
- [ ] Share captivating visual presentations to clients using their weather data as part of a Choropleth Map
